Disney again decided to earn some cash remaking their beloved cartoons in live action,
this time the 1989 fairy tale adaptation that started the Disney Renaissance, 
with Halle Bailey as Ariel (who thankfully is still a redhead). 
Like most of those remakes, The Little Mermaid delivers most of what audiences 
liked in the original but padding it to two hours with things that mostly don't 
improve the story and only serve to remind how tight and well-paced those animated features were. 
Hence reviews were average, but box office prospects are still big, probably on par with the Aladdin
and Beauty and the Beast remakes.
