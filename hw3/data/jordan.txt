In 1984, Nike signed promising rookie Michael Jordan to a deal that would create the still thriving Air Jordan shoe line, 
something chronicled in the movie Air. One of the basketballers who would sign an exclusivity deal with the brand and even
 get some signature sneakers was Carmelo Anthony, who announced his retirement at 38 of a career who started in the same
 Nuggets of #10 (who 'Melo couldn't bring to the finals over the Lakers).
